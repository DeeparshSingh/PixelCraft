# Pixel Art Generator using Genetic Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate pixel art based on a target image. The algorithm simulates evolutionary processes such as **mutation**, **crossover**, and **selection** to iteratively improve the generated pixel art towards resembling a target image. The fitness of each generated image is evaluated using the **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**.

### Key Features:
- Genetic Algorithm for image evolution
- SSIM-based fitness evaluation
- Configurable parameters for mutation, population size, and generations
- Visualizations of fitness progression and population diversity

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by initializing a population of random images.
2. **Fitness Calculation**: The fitness of each image is determined by calculating the SSIM between the generated and target image.
3. **Selection**: Images with higher fitness are selected for reproduction.
4. **Crossover and Mutation**: Offspring are generated by combining pixel values from two parent images. Mutations are applied randomly to introduce variations.
5. **Evolution**: The process is repeated over several generations to gradually improve the population of images.
6. **Termination**: The algorithm stops when it reaches a predefined number of generations or no further improvement is observed.
